How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
-we can keep changes temproraly at staging area till we make meaningful change then we commit it
so that we do not create much commits


run the command "git checkout "branch name" " to make commits on that branch not on the master brach.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?
- to try an experimental change without edit the original code 
-to make another beta version of of the code 
-to try to fix somthing and if it works then merge it with the master branch
